## Hi there 👋 I'm Kaisei
**Thank you for visiting my profile. I have learned programming by myself and have experienced through personal projects in some programming languages**

## Tech
### Frontend
**👨‍💻Coding** : Most of my experience is in developing websites using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. For HTML, CSS I associated with that most so I know how to coding or develop websites. Regarding Javascript, I also developed websites which is dynamic and animation. For WordPress, I can create websites from theme and have some knowledge of PHP.  

**🎨Design** : Basically, my focus has been programming though, I am also curious about design. When I created my own websites, I looked up some design rules and law that how websites create for people, what is the law to attract to others and create stunning UI. I think therefore, I want to know more and gain experiences about design, as I work codings.   

You can see my websites where I designed and developed here. 

### Backend
I have only limited experience with Django, as I developed a web application with it.

## Hi there 👋 I'm Kaisei
**Thank you for visiting my profile. I am web developer and designer based in Hyogo, Japan**

## Tech
### Frontend
**👨‍💻Coding** : Most of my experience is in developing websites using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. For HTML, CSS I associated with that most so I know how to coding or develop websites. Regarding Javascript, I also developed websites which is dynamic and animation. For WordPress, I can create websites from theme and have some knowledge of PHP.  

**🎨Design** : I use Figma when designing. I like to see and create designs that are simple, modern, and minimal, mainly focusing on typography. Simple designs may look easy, but as I work with my hands, I’ve realized there’s more to them—designers carefully consider what is truly necessary. I'm passionate about improving my design skills to create such thoughtful designs

### Backend
I have only limited experience with Django, when I developed a web application with it.

## Fun facts
🙋**About me** : I’m not sure if my ultimate goal is to become a software engineer. I also haven’t figured out what I want to do in the future. However, I’m thankful to have learned programming, and I’m interested in continuing to explore this field. I’d like to try different things and learn along the way. I’m still figuring it out!  


🌱 **Language learning** : Since 2024, I have been learning English and enjoying the process😊. However, I rarely have opportunities to use it in real life, even though I want to use it since I focus to improve my speaking and talking skill. If you are looking for a language exchange partner or want to improve your speaking skills, Let’s support each other! Feel free to reach out and send me a message. Additionally, If you consider whether I can work together in English, give me a chance to try. I'll do my best.

## Hi there 👋 I'm Kaisei
**Thank you for visiting my profile. I have learned programming by myself and have experienced through personal projects in some languages**

## Tech
### Frontend
**👨‍💻Coding** : Most of my experience is in developing websites using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. For HTML, CSS I associated with that most so I know how to coding or develop websites. Regarding Javascript, I also developed websites which is dynamic and animation. For WordPress, I can create websites from theme and have some knowledge of PHP.  

**🎨Design** : While my focus has been programming, I am curious about design, not just for websites but also for other types of products.  

You can see my websites where I designed and developed here. 

### Backend
I have only limited experience with Django, as I developed a web application with it.

🙋**About me** : I’m not sure if my ultimate goal is to become a software engineer. I also haven’t figured out what I want to do in the future. However, I’m thankful to have learned programming, and I’m interested in continuing to explore this field. I’d like to try different things and learn along the way. I’m still figuring it out!  

🌱 **Language learning** : Since 2024, I have been learning English and enjoying the process 😊. However, I rarely have opportunities to use it in real life.

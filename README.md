## Hi there 👋 I'm Kaisei
**Thank you for visiting my profile. I have learned programming by myself and have experienced to develop some languages**

## Tech
### Frontend
**👨‍💻Coding** : Mostly I have experienced to develop somethings related to websites;**HTML, CSS(Sass), Javascript, WordPress**. For HTML, CSS I assciated with that most so I know how to coding or develop websites and when it comes to Javascript, I also developed websites which is dynamic and animation. For WordPress, I can create websites with Wordpress from theme so I know about PHP a little bit.  

**🎨Design** : While my focus has been programming, I am curious about design, not just for websites but also for other types of products.  

You can see my websites where I designed and developed here. 

### Backend
I've experienced a little bit Django since I developed web application though, I'm not familiar with Backend, also about related to database compared Frontend.

🙋**About me** : I’m not sure if my ultimate goal is to become a software engineer. I also haven’t figured out what I want to do in the future. However, I’m thankful to have learned programming, and I’m interested in continuing to explore this field. I’d like to try different things and learn along the way. I’m still figuring it out!
